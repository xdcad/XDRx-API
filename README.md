1.Installation help:


===================================================

1. Unzip the file to the specified directory

2. Depending on your AutoCAD version, the 32-bit version of AutoCAD corresponds to x86, and the 64-bit version of AutoCAD corresponds to x64. Find the corresponding ARX file
     For example: the corresponding arx file for AutoCAD 2025 is: xdrx.2025.x64.arx
     
4. Use the mouse to drag the file install.lsp to the ACAD window, 
                                  Select the specified ARX file in the SYS directory,
                                  After confirmation, if prompted when loading, choose to load.

5. Finished. This process only needs to be performed once, and XDrx API will be automatically loaded when AUTOCAD is started later
